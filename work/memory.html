        <h3>Project: Memory Game</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>This Game was designed with the intention to help those in early stages of Alzheimer's to have access to
                a game which forces them to use their mind. To make sure this goal was met, the team took the game to be
                tested by staff at the Berkeley Alzheimer's facility. The game was designed and directed by a team of 3
                students for the CSUMB capstone. The design team also communicated with the developers from India to
                make sure they were meeting their milestones. I designed a simple logo for the project and built a
                little website to show off some of our work. Technologies used : Unity, HTC Vive, Weebly, Adobe
                illustrator & photoshop.</p>
