        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Review of the <span>old website</span> revealed there were a lot of issues that needed to be addressed.
                First off the website had not been touched in the last 10+ years, meaning a lot of design choices did
                not age gracefully. Some mentionable choices are large bodies of text, drop down menus, and pages only
                containing one paragraph. Along with many design and functional issues, a 3rd party was managing the
                site which only complicated things more. The combination of these issues made it obvious that the
                website needed to be rebuilt and be kept completely internal. The new website was completely designed
                and coded by myself and I believe it addresses all of the concerns with the old site as well as give a
                better sense of what the client stands for.</p>
        </div>
        <p>BEFORE - OLD LOGO</p>
        <div id="old-logo">
            <img alt="re&m-old-logo" src="./images/work/remp-web/old-remp-logo.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>The <span>old logo</span> also had some issues, primarily it needed to be updated to accommodate the new
                partner. There were also visual inconsistencies with the old design, the spacing and sizes of the boxes
                were not even and nobody was a fan of the color choices. The "&" was overpowering the other letters and
                the subtext under the main body was lost when printed small. There were a lot of revisions when coming
                to the final logo design, but I believe the final design solves previously mentioned issues as well as
                positions the brand more in line with how the firm conducts itself.</p>
        </div>
        <p>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</p>
        <div class="analysis">
            <img alt="competitive analysis" src="./images/work/remp-web/analysis.svg" />
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Before I dove into <span>redesigning</span> the brand and how it would extend across all marketing touch
                points. I felt it was important to get an understanding of the competitive landscape by focusing on the
                California competitive set. I then aggregated their styles and plotted them in a magic quadrant grid
                that held two ranges - Inclusive to Exclusive, and Futuristic to Traditional. I noticed that many firms
                had moved their branding to be more futuristic and soaked in blue, which makes
                sense considering the affinity of blue tones in Tech, the Bay Area's source of uncommon wealth.
                The top right quadrant which covered Futuristic and Exclusive seemed unpopulated, and frankly, meshed
                well with my client's positioning in the market where they do no advertising, no outreach, and only take
                on new clients through personal referrals.

        <p>LOGO DESIGN VARIATION</p>
        <div class="analysis">
            <img alt="logo comparisons" src="./images/work/remp-web/logos.svg" />
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Obviously the <span>new logo</span> would not be completed in a single go, there was a lot of iteration.
                Pictured above are just a few of the different designs I presented to the client during which I would
                explain my thinking and reference the research I conducted. The same process was also done to the font
                type which was used as a starting point for these logos.</p>
        </div>
        <p>AFTER - NEW LOGO</p>
        <div id="new-logo">
            <img alt="new-remp-logo" src="./images/work/remp-web/new-remp-logo.svg" />
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>The <span>new logo</span> I feel captures the energy the firm has in a more accurate way than previous
                designs. This design was one of the dozen of iterations that I created, but was the one that did the
                best in every scale and context. Not only does it excel in a printed format such as a business card or
                letterhead, it also holds up on desktop and mobile websites. I wanted to get rid of distracting design
                devices such as the "&", squares, and subtext that disappears when scaled down. The logo and branding
                should reflect the company and I believe a strong, confident, clean logo with a clear message in this
                case was the best choice. This also allowed for more customization for the partners, with the logo as a
                neutral color, this allows each partner to have their own identity within the firm; this can be seen on
                the new website as well as business cards.</p>

        <div class="paragraph end-of-project">
            <p>With the <span>new website</span> I wanted to continue with the style the logo had, simple and strong. I
                kept the colors to a minimum, white with each of the partner's unique color. While scrolling the site,
                the background will change according to each partner's color. This theme also carries
                over to the print media and especially with the customized business cards. I could keep talking about
                why I made certain decisions, but I think it would make more sense to just see the site first hand. The

                redesigned their previous website which was built using SquareSpace to something that I thought
                reflected their style and attitude more accurately. Since then, the site has gotten some updates while,
